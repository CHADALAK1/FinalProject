 * <p>
 *     DamageType class is an object to debate on how the damage will take
 *     place depending on the armor and Magic Resist(depending if we implement).
 *     Reasoning behind this instead of using a base int damage amount is to make
 *     a variety for challenging ways to apply damage to the player or NPC's
 *     advantage or disadvantage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     FOR EXAMPLE: if the player has armor on and the NPC hits the player with
 *     Melee. The player is going to receive less damage from the hit on the
 *     Melee attack because the armor helps resist the base damage from the
 *     Melee attack.
