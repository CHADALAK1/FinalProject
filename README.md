# FinalProject

THIS PROJECT IS USING THE 'INTELLIJ IDEA' IDE.(currently using the Community version because its free)
You must install IntelliJ IDEA to work with this project.

It's quite easy to clone the project to your PC/MAC.
When opening IntelliJ, usually it prompts with a window to start a new project.
HOWEVER,
there is an option at the bottom to "Check in from Repository" then select "GitHub"

it will then ask you to login to your GitHub (no worries it's all completely free).
I will also need the username of your github account to add you to the repository collaborators(meaning to edit
the source code of the project)

once this is all established you are ready to edit the Java code and make the final project complete :D
